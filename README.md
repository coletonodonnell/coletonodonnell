### About Me
- My name is Coleton O'Donnell. I am a Senior at FLVS and love programming, data hoarding, advocating for privacy, and all things Linux. I am working to obtaining my Degree in Computer Science. My dream job is either Kernel Development or something to do with compilers. I love low level!
- I program in Python and Rust primarily, but know C++ and Java as well. I am working on learning as much programming theory as I can currently.
