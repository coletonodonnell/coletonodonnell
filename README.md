### About Me
- My name is Coleton O'Donnell. I am a student at the University of Florida, studying Computer Science. I love data hoarding, advocating for privacy, programming, and all things Linux. My dream job is either Kernel Development or something to do with compilers. I love low level and am always trying to learn more!
- I program in Rust, C, C++ and Python primarily, but know some Java as well. I am working on learning as much programming theory as I can currently. Rust is my favorite language so far.
