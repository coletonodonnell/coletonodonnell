### About Me
- My name is Coleton O'Donnell. I work as a Linux Engineer at Jump Trading and I am a student at the University of Florida, studying Computer Science. I love data hoarding, advocating for privacy, programming, and all things Linux. 
- I program in Rust, C, C++ and Python primarily, but know some Java as well. I am working on learning as much theory as I can currently. Rust is my favorite language so far.
